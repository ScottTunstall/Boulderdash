Attribute format: %00000000 000000aa<P>

aa: Initial "facing" direction:
<UL>
    <LI>00 = facing left
    <LI>01 = facing up
    <LI>10 = facing right
    <LI>11 = facing down
</UL>
Note: These codes are <EM>different</EM> than those used internally by the Commodore 64
implementation of Boulder Dash. The above codes are the same as for the <A HREF="0008.html">firefly</A>,
for consistency, rather than the C64 implementation which uses 00=down, 01=left, 10=up,
11=right.<P>

All fireflies should start life "facing down" (aa=11). This means that the first
movement a butterfly will make is left (if possible), because the fly will turn to its right, resulting
in moving left.

This GIF shows the animation sequence of a butterfly from the C64 implementation of Boulder Dash (hence the
graphics are 8 double-width pixels wide and 16 pixels high).


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Interactions">Interactions with other objects</A></H2>
The butterfly interacts with the following objects:
<UL>
    <LI>Explodes on contact with: <A HREF="000A.html">amoeba</A>, <A HREF="0006.html">Rockford</A>, Rockford (scanned this frame)
</UL>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Specification">Specification</A></H2>
Butterflies are the same as <A HREF="0008.html">fireflies</A> except
<UL>
	<LI>butterflies usually begin life facing down rather than left
	<LI>butterflies prefer to go to their right (failing that go straight, failing that turn left)
	<LI>they look different
	<LI>when they explode, they explode to diamonds rather than space
</UL>

Please refer to the <A HREF="0008.html">firefly</A> specification for full details.
