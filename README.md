# Boulderdash

## Overview

A version of Boulderdash I wrote in 1998. I would have been 25 years old. 

Quite proud of this one as it's a Mode 13h full screen smooth scroller with really nice graphics (I didn't create the sprites though)

## Required tools

Needs MS-DOS, Turbo Pascal 7 and a copy of my KOJAKVGA graphics unit (also available on this Github) to compile. 

DosBox should let you run this game after you build it.. but I haven't tried it.


## Files

IMG files are bespoke sprite files. I didn't even THINK of sprite sheets at that time.

PAL files are bespoke palette files that define the 256 colour palette for the game.  

PCX files are run length encoded bitmaps very popular at the time - you should be able to open them with MS-Paint or suchlike. If not, Google will find you a PCX Viewer!

PAS files are Pascal source. 

INC files are include files.
